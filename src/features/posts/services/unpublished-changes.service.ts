/*
 * Unpublished Changes compare two fingerprints kept on the Post: the draft's
 * and the one taken when it was published (see the columns on posts.table).
 * Publishing writes both. Every other write that can change the fingerprinted
 * fields only clears the draft's, in the same statement as the write, so
 * there is no window in which it is stale. A null fingerprint on a Published
 * Post means "compute me", and this module computes it: from the current
 * draft for the draft's, and for the published one from the Post's latest
 * publish Post Revision, which holds the draft's content as it was published,
 * and from its public Category and Tags, which are what the public site shows
 * (ADR 0033). A Category or Tag deleted since is already gone from them. The
 * Admin reads settle before they answer.
 *
 * This is also how Posts published before fingerprints existed are filled
 * in: the migration cannot hash, so it leaves null (migration 0026). Their
 * public Category and Tags were backfilled from the live ones (migration
 * 0025), so a Post whose only edits since publishing were to Category or
 * Tags has no Unpublished Changes.
